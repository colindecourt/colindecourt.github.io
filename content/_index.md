# About me


I am a 2nd year PhD student at [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/) (Artificial Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute), supported by the Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées, in the frame of "programme d'investissements d'avenir PIA3" (Plan Villani). 

I received my Master’s degree in telecommunications and artificial intelligence from Bordeaux INP - ENSEIRB-MATMECA (Bordeaux, France) in 2020. I started my PhD with ISAE-SUPAERO, CerCo (CNRS UMR5549) and NXP Semiconductors in October 2020, under the supervision of [Rufin VanRullen](https://rufinv.github.io/) (CerCo), [Thomas Oberlin](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/thomas-oberlin/?lang=fr) (DISC, ISAE-SUPAERO) and Didier Salle (NXP Semiconductors).

My research focuses on adapting and developing deep learning algorithms for scene understanding using automotive FMCW radars (target detection, classification and tracking) and artificial intelligence. My areas of interest are image and signal processing, radar and computer vision.
