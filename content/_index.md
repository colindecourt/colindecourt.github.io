# About me

I obtained my PhD in artificial intelligence from the University of Toulouse in 2023. My thesis took place under [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/) (Artificial Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute), supported by the Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées, and was supervised by [Rufin VanRullen](https://rufinv.github.io/) (CerCo), [Thomas Oberlin](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/thomas-oberlin/?lang=fr) (DISC, ISAE-SUPAERO) and Didier Salle (NXP Semiconductors). During my PhD, I worked on adapting and developing deep learning algorithms (supervised and self-supervised) for scene understanding using automotive FMCW radars (target detection, classification and tracking) and artificial intelligence. 

Previous, I received my Master’s degree in telecommunications and artificial intelligence from Bordeaux INP - ENSEIRB-MATMECA (Bordeaux, France) in 2020.

My areas of interest are image and signal processing, artificial intelligence and computer vision.
