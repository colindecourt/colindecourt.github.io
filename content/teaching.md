This page provides a summary of the different subjects that I have taught (and currently teach) at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) and [University of Toulouse 3 - Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) as part of my PhD.
 

#### [Introduction to artificial intelligence - Object detection and classification](https://rufinv.github.io/Intro2AI-class/)

##### [Course page](https://colindecourt.github.io/od_os_course/)

Online course provided by *ANITI* (2021 and 2022) - Assistant professor 

**Contents:**
